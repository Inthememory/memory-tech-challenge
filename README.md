## 🏆 Full-Stack Engineer Technical Challenge  

#### 🎯 Goal

The goal of this challenge is to build a small e-commerce dashboard from sample order transactions. 
The [data](https://github.com/Inthememory/memory-tech-challenge/blob/master/memory-tech-challenge-data.csv.zip) is provided in this repository. The dashboard should be based off a web page that a user can visit and interact with. 

The page should have two blocks:

##### 1. Summary view
This block should display the three following metrics:
- Total revenue
- Average revenue per order
- Number of unique customers

##### 2. Monthly view
This block should be a graph showing the evolution of total revenue by month.


We should be able to filter the entire dashboard by `Country`. (We should also be able to filter by `All`).

Here is mockup of what it should look like:

#### ℹ️  Guidelines 

- Use whatever language/framework you want.
- Please submit your project as a `git` repository (so please include the `.git` directory in the upload). Check in commits as you reach certain milestones. If you need to take a break, check in a commit with something like `Taking a break` followed by `Resuming work` when you are ready to begin again.
- Try to keep it simple.
- Do not spend more than 8 hours on the challenge.

#### 🎁 Bonus Point 

Make the dashboard publicly accessible through a url.
